Drimjas
=======

### Introduction

Drimjas is a tool designed for commercial photographers to enable them to
quickly and easily write up estimates, contracts, and invoices on the move.

### Design

Drimjas was designed in the era of iOS 6, (but still works great under iOS 7!)
with a cascading workflow design. Enter the details as required, Drimjas will
automatically save some details to the app so you never have to fill them out
again, then when you're done Drimjas will generate a beautifully and professionally
formatted document for emailing or printing.

Never again worry about the paperwork hassles of life as a professional photographer!
